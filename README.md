Simple Feedforward Neural Network from Scratch

Objective
This project implements a simple feedforward neural network from scratch in Python, without relying on any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It demonstrates the core concepts of:

Forward propagation

Backward propagation (back-propagation)

Training using gradient descent

The network is designed to work with basic datasets and serves as a learning tool for understanding the inner workings of neural networks.

Features
Custom implementation of layers and activation functions

Manual computation of gradients for back-propagation

Mini-batch training using gradient descent

Simple loss function (Mean Squared Error)

Easily extendable structure
